## Activity One: Visuals Speaks
First Picture is bacon and a frying pan. 

The frying pan symbolizes this bootcamp giving me the skills and confidence to be successful as a software developer. So currently I am the raw bacon,
the potential to be delicious but not until it is cooked. So I hope to get the cooking here!

Second Picture:

Money, coins. Really just being financially successful, and supporting my family. As a software developer. 

### How I will get there. 
I hope to bridge this gap by firstly completing this course and applying for jobs. I have wanted to get into the tech industry but wasn't sure 
how I was able to afford going back to school completely. Finding funding through Techire has really helped me right the ship and get back 
towards a dream of mine. So through the support that is around me, Dan and his network, Techire assistance if necessary for internship funding
assistance, I hope to get into either a developed Tech Company or a start and and start working building software and apps. I truly enjoy creating things
and seeing how they are used by poeple, so getting to a point where I can do that would be awesome. Once I have my foot in the door, I plan to work
hard and prove myself as an asset to the company. I believe I have great soft skills and can build relationships incredibly well so if I can prove myself to
be both an intellectual asset and someone that everyone enjoys working with I can show my worth to a company.
