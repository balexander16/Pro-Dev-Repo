## Week 4 Reflection

That was a hard week, forcing myself to call myself a software developer and taking our first exams all in one week felt like a whirlwind. The meeting at 1 Millions Cups was successful, I wish I had had the guts to get up at the beginning but I did manage to set up a meeting with someone. 

Actually my most successful self imaging moment came on Friday after the test. I had decided to go out and grab a beer while my wife was out with our daughter. I overheard someone talking about tech opportunities and introduced myself as a software developer. We exchanged emails, he primarily does web services but their company was very interested in branching into apps and he said he would love to meet with me when the course was over. 

Dabovo LLC interesting to have a lead, feels really good and validating that I could chat him up and seem knowledgable enough for the intial questions he had to exchange emails. I followed up with an email asking for more about what they did. Very exciting! I think every time i get a moment like this will feel easier and easier to call my self a developer and do my elevator pitch.
