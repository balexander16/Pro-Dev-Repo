## Reflection on Forbidden Island

I found myself taking on a bit of a leading role since I had played the game before, the team seemed receptive of my instructions. We worked 
together well, everyone was able to speak up and contribute well. Took us a while to remember our abilities and use them well. 

### Other teammates:
* John: Was willing to take instructions, thought outside the box. Creative thinker, likes to have feedback of how to implement his ideas. 
* Trey: Feels comfortable speaking up and leading. Has good ideas often. 
* Austin: A little bit of the quieter person in the group. Still contributes meaningfully. Had a great ability we could have used sooner in the game
to be more successful. 
* Me: I love collaborative work and games, very extroverted person. I do have a tendancy to take the lead. Need to give others the platform to 
input ideas more freely sometimes. Get caught in the moment of what I want to do and forget to let others shine sometimes, but I am aware of this 
and want to improve.

### What worked well in general:
Once we actually started playing it was easier then bogging through the instructions. Playing is the best way to learn. Sometimes we just need to 
start instead of just get overly involved in some things. Came to decisions together, what are our ideas, then what was the best idea, then did it!
