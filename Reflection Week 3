## Week 3 Reflection

The course has been difficult as expected, but it is very exciting to actually have an app we have created that I can put on my phone and use. 
I'm honestly still confused with alot but its slowly making more sense. I feel like I'm on a week delay for things, so we are doing something 
and I can follow along coding but if I want to create something myself thats another story!

I'm very excited to start more on the personal android project, the idea of creating something myself and getting to use it and play around
with it is awesome! I was worried at first that I wouldn't have ideas but the more we spend time brain-storming more ideas are coming. 
The idea for my personal android project is an image detection utilizing app that prompts users to walk around taking pictures off of 
prompts to complete a choose your own adventure roleplaying story. Initial versions will have a very simple linear branching paths to 
keep the scope narrow enough for the time allowed. Hopefully I can accomplish this using either Amazon Rekognition, Google Cloud Vision, or 
Clarifai. Depends upon how many pictures I will actually be using they have a limited scope of free development usability.
